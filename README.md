## The Chocolate Bar Problem: A Coding Challenge 

There are 0 < m < 1000 chocolate bars of varying (integer) lengths and  
0 < n < 1000 hungry children who want differing amounts of chocolate (again, positive 
integer amounts). Your aim is to feed all of the children the correct amount whilst 
making the fewest cuts to the chocolate bars. Return -1 if there is no solution. 

#Task 
Write a program to distribute chocolate so that you make as few cuts as possible. We 
are more interested in solutions that get close to the minimum than those that take 
an exponential amount of time.
